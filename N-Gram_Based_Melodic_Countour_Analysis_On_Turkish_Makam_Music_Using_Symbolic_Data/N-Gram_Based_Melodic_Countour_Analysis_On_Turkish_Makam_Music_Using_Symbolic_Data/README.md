Abstract: 
Musicological analysis of Turkish makam music is underdeveloped. Due to its microtonal structure, complex and rich history, and oral traditions, the computational study of makamlar is lacking. In this study we investigate melodic contours using n-grams to build feature strings representative of the direction of movement of the notes within a sequence. We explore the prevalence of these melodic patterns and the relation they have to other music concepts in Turkish makam music such as çes¸nis and seyir. Ultimately, we provide a new and interesting approach to the study of Turkish makam music.
